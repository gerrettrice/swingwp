<p>This website was developed for a baseball and softball training center for a grad school project. The two pages feature:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Responsive design for mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-browser compatibility (full disclosure: the grids aren&#8217;t working in Firefox. I spent too much time trying to troubleshoot, but I was too far along to risk compromising a structure that works in Safari and Chrome).</p></li>
<li><p>Simple implementation of Sass mixins, variables, and nesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Web animations with keyframes (fade on slider heading) and transitions (hover effect on buttons and nav).</p></li>
<li><p>Use of SVG (logo in header).</p></li>
<li><p>Use of Flexbox (nav and &#8216;Teams Training with Us&#8217; on About page).</p></li>
<li><p>Use of grid layout (&#8216;Learn More&#8217; sections on Home page and &#8216;Teams Training with Us&#8217; on About page).</p></li>
</ul>
