* Web animations with keyframes (fade on slider heading) and transitions (hover effect on buttons and nav).

*  Use of SVG (logo in header).

* Use of Flexbox (nav and 'Teams Training with Us' on About page).

* Use of grid layout ('Learn More' sections on Home page and 'Teams Training with Us' on About page).
